        <Typography variant="body1">
          CounterPointer is a teaching tool to help music theory students learn more about species counterpoint. You can use the web editor to input your melody, see generated example countermelodies, or write your own countermelody and check it against the set of counterpoint rules, all while being able to listen to your score played back on a piano in real time. Instead of manually checking for rule violations, you can immediately get feedback on your countermelody and quickly correct any mistakes.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          To get started, use the <Typography variant="button">load</Typography> button to load an example score in to play around with. Check out the <Typography variant="button">hotkeys</Typography> tab to see how to use the score editor. Remember, you can always bring up this welcome screen by clicking the <Typography variant="button">help</Typography> button. The alto clef is always the melody line, and the other clef is the countermelody line.
